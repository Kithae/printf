This directory contains files on C â€“ printf.
This is our first team project done during software engineering course at ALX

Task 0 is a function that produces output according to a format,
	It is set to emulate the standard library function Printf.

Task 1 is a function that handle some conversion specifiers passed to it,
     prints the convesrions as specified.

Task 2 is a function that Handle custom conversion specifiers,
     converts unsigned int to Binary.

Task 3 is a function that Handle conversion specifier,
     the specifiers includes, hexadecimal and others.

Task 4 is a function that Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible,
     this writes all characters from buffer.

Task 5 is a function that handle some custom conversion specifiers,
     prints string and and non printable charcters.

Task 6 is a function that handle the conversion specifier,

Task 7 is a function that handle flag characters for non custom specifiers,
     this include, space, hash tag and the positive sighn.

Task 8 is a function that handle length modifiers for non custom specifies,
     this include, integer, hexadecimal and others.

Task 9 is a function that handles field width for non custom specifiers.

Task 10 is a function that handles the precision for non custom specifiers.

Task 11 is a function that handles the 0 flag character for non custom specifiers.

Task 12 is a function that negative (-) flag character for non custom specifiers

Task 13 is function that handles a custom conversion specifier which is,
	r that prints the reversed string.

Task 14 is a function that handles a custom conversion specifier which is,
